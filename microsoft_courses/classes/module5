With classes you can use common patterns by OOP, we have the same classes
components like: Constructor, the access pointers (get and set), and the methods.

We have also access alter:
Public to all the public methods and value, we can access by whatever other class,
private to define a method and value, we can't access, only the constructor,
protected works only with the methods or values that are inside of the class or subclasses,
the same thing that OOP.

We have the inheritance concept to extend a class with other, in the same way that Java.

We can implement an interface as a data structure or contract of values with required
fields and optional fields.

Interface vs Classes
The interfaces only are contact that we define of what gonna do, the classes give us more
information about how and where gonna do something and in the classes we need to create a
constructor to consume the data.

NOTE: We only must include one constructor function in the class definition.
